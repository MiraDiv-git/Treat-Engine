# Treat Engine

![Engine for devs by devs](TreatGit.png)



## What is Treat Engine?
Treat Engine is a simple but powerful 2D engine, oriented toward indie devs.

It uses **Python** as the *scripting language* and **ModernGL** as the *rendering API*,
making development simple and giving you full control over the hardware.

It is distributed as open-source under the GPL 2.0 licence - highly recommend 
giving it a read before forking the engine ;)



## Features

- **Python Scripting** - Write game logic in familiar Python syntax
- **ModernGL Rendering** - Hardware-accelerated OpenGL graphics
- **Cross-Platform** - Windows, Linux, macOS support
- **2D Graphics** - Sprite rendering, textures, and animations
- **Lightweight Architecture** - Minimal overhead, fast startup times



## Installation

### Automated:
1. Clone repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MiraDiv-git/Treat-Engine.git
```
2. Simply run **install.sh** on _Linux / macOS_ or **install.bat** on _Windows_.
Let the scripts do all work for you :)

### Manual:
1. Clone repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MiraDiv-git/Treat-Engine.git
```
2. Create virtual environment inside this folder:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
./.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt # on Linux / macOS
.venv\Scripts\pip.exe install -r requirements.txt # on Windows
```
Also install TKInter support on Linux / macOS:
```bash
sudo apt install -y python3.13-tk # Ubuntu / Debian
sudo yum install -y python3.13-tkinter # RHEL / CentOS
sudo dnf install -y python3.13-tkinter # Fedora
sudo pacman -S --noconfirm tk # Arch
brew install python-tk@3.13 # macOS using Homebrew
```
4. Run Treat Engine:

```bash
./run.sh # on Linux / macOS
run.bat # on Windows
```
Or run it manually:
```bash
./.venv/bin/python main.py # on Linux / macOS
.venv\Scripts\python.exe main.py # on Windows
```
You can also check the [Releases](https://github.com/MiraDiv-git/Treat-Engine/releases) page for 
compiled executable files



## Building
Treat Engine uses [Nuitka](https://nuitka.net/) for compilation.

To build the project into executable file, **use automated scripts in *build* folder.**

If you prefer to build it manually, here are the minimal commands:
```bash
# On Linux / macOS
./.venv/bin/nuitka main.py --onefile --include-data-dir=shaders=shaders --output-dir=./build/unix

# On Windows
.venv\Scripts\nuitka.exe main.py --onefile --include-data-dir=shaders=shaders --output-dir=.\build\windows
```
The --output-dir flag specifies the directory where the compiled files will be generated.
You can omit it — in that case, the files will be placed directly in the project root.
