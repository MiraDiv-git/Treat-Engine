# Treat Engine

(\*insert a cool image or logo here*)

## **About:**  
Treat Engine is a simple but powerful 2D engine, oriented toward indie devs.

It uses **Python** as the *scripting language* and **ModernGL** as the *rendering API*,
making development simple and giving you full control over the hardware.

It is distributed as open-source under the GPL 2.0 licence - highly recommend 
giving it a read before forking the engine ;)


## Features

- Game logic scripting with **Python**
- Rendering via **ModernGL** (*OpenGL*)  
- Lightweight and minimalistic
- Open-source code under GPL 2.0 license
